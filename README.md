# Chess

`Chess` is a two-player chess game written in Java.

## Running

Once you've downloaded the JAR, you can start the game by typing

```bash
java -jar Chess.jar
```

in the terminal of your choice.

## How it works

Once you've started the game, you see a chessboard on the screen. Player one is at the bottom, player two at the top. The pieces name's are four characters wide, so some of them are cut; I'm sure you know, what pieces they are :smile:.

To make a move, just type `START_FIELD STOP_FIELD`, e.g. `A2 A4`.

Have fun!
